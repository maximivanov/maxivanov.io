    <p>I've started this blog as a way to share my professional findings, deepen my knowledge by <a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/">learning in public</a> and extend my professional network.</p>
    <p>Since childhood, I was around computers thanks to my father - an engineer and electronics enthusiast. I don't think I ever had any doubt about my future career back then.</p>
    <p>In 2008 I've graduated with a CS degree from a university in Saint-Petersburg, Russia and I've been working as a software engineer ever since.</p>
    <p>In 2014 I've joined <a href="https://www.toptal.com#pick-the-top-contractors">Toptal</a> and started working remotely as a contractor. I'm quite happy being remote and I don't see myself going back to an office anytime soon.</p>
    <p>In 2016, with my family and a dog, I've moved to Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ - a great country generous with its ocean, sun, and friendly people.</p>
    <p>Nowadays, some of the keywords that catch my interest, in no particular order:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cloud technology</li>
      <li>AWS</li>
      <li>Azure</li>
      <li>TypeScript</li>
      <li>Node.js</li>
      <li>Serverless</li>
      <li>Information security</li>
      <li>Performance</li>
      <li>Scalability</li>
      <li>Testing (all kinds of it)</li>
      <li>DevOps</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Outside of work I like to go outdoors to hike or ride my bicycle. If the mood is to stay at home I'd read or cook and invite friends for a barbeque.</p>
